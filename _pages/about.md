A Little More About Me

I discovered technical writing late in my computer science degree and fell in love with it. It seemed too late for me to change degree programs, but I was able to attain an English minor and Technical Writing Certificate with my degree. Creating documents that are helpful to others and beautifully organized is rewarding work for me, and a career choice I wish to pursue. After graduating, I have been enrolled in an extended study program to expand my technical writing portfolio and prepare for the CPTC Foundation Certification exam.

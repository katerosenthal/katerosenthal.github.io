I discovered technical writing late in my computer science degree and fell in love with it. It was too late for me to change degree programs, but I was able to attain an English minor and Technical Writing Certificate with my degree. After graduating, I have been enrolled in an extended study program to expand my technical writing portfolio and prepare for the CPTC Foundation Certification exam. Creating documents that are helpful to others and beautifully organized is rewarding work that I am highly driven to make into a career.

When I'm not working, I enjoy knitting, hiking, and both video and board gaming!

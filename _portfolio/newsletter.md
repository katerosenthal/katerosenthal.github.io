## Project Title

**December Newsletter**

## Context
This newsletter was written for the nonprofit organization The Intermountain Fair Housing Council (IFHC) and was intended to act as a short case for support for a fundraiser. As a case for support, it includes recent work by the IFHC, explains the eventâ€™s importance and impact, says where the money raised goes, asks for donations, and tracks its goals. It was designed to be modular so that each section could be included or removed and easily editable for reusability. It was also written using similar styling and formatting to past newsletters and with a voice consistent with the IFHC's social media presence. The entire document was created using Canva.

## Target Audience
The target audience of this newsletter is existing IFHC newsletter recipients as well as their friends and family.

## Project Title

**Proposal to Create a Comprehensive Training Program for Onboarding Front of House Staff at Store #6**

## Context
This is an unsolicited proposal I am writing to address the lack of a standardized training program at a restaurant. Research shows that stronger training programs can contribute to improved employee performance, satisfaction, and retention. The goal of this document is to persuade an audience that a better training program is needed and will be beneficial, as well as provide a solution to create one. 

The actual name of the restaurant is left out intentionally.

## Target Audience
The target audience of this proposal is the store's management staff and corporate office.

## Document
Coming Soon!

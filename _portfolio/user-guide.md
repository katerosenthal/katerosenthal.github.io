## Project Title

**KnApp: The Knee Visualization App User Guide**

## Context
This user guide was created for a student web application project. The application was created to take specially formatted data sheets from a Computational Biosciences Lab, and use them to create a heatmap of pressure on a knee. Because the data sheets were formatted so specifically, the guide covers how they should be formatted, how they should be named, and how to use the application. The project was also expected to be iterated on by students in future semesters, so it was not a fully completed project. There is a section of 'Known Issues' in the guide for this reason, which would not normally appear in a user guide.

## Target Audience
The target audience of this guide was our professor and all the application's users.
